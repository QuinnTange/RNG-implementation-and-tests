To use this code, go to main and change the parameters of lines 17, 19, or 20. If you want to test Middle Square Method, change line 17, please use a 4 digit number without a leading 0. If you would like to test LCG, please change lines 19 or 20 with appropriate parameters for m, a, c, and the seed. See our paper to learn how to get especially good parameters for LCG, but any positive integers will work to create a pseudorandom sequence. As we have discussed in depth, it is difficult to know if the algorithm is truly pseudorandom, but I've included some helper print statements to show the period of the sequence generated by your parameters.
